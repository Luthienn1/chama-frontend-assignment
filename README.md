### Goal

Test my knowledge of the technologies of the project through a real challenge of a company in search of developers. I am not participating in the tryouts, but the challenge is open to anyone who wants to do so.

### Techs

- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

### Features

- [x] Search for users of the Github API and show them.
- [x] Show already searched users listed by timestamp.
- [x] Allow to search again from the history.

### Requiriments & How to run

Having Node.js and Git, clone the repository and then just npm install and npm start or yarn and yarn start.
